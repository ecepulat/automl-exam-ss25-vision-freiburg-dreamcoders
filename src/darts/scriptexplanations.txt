train_search.py		🔍 Main search loop — where DARTS optimizes alpha and w.
train.py		🏋️ Retrains the final (discretized) architecture from scratch.
model_search.py		📐 Network definition used during the architecture search phase.
model.py		📐 Network used for final training (after search completes).
operations.py		🔧 Defines all candidate operations (e.g., conv 3x3, maxpool, etc.).
genotypes.py		🧬 Stores and loads architectures (as named configurations).
architect.py		🎯 Bilevel optimization logic — the core of DARTS gradient updates.
utils.py		🔧 Logging, checkpointing, and helper functions.
visualize.py		🧠 Visualizes architectures (optional, useful for debugging).
test.py			✅ Basic testing script (optional).
